[00:00.26] Way up in the sky
[00:01.36] There used to be heartbeat
[00:03.09] A full of the folly, so-called civilization
[00:06.32] It's only me who knows that
[00:07.88] It's hideous yet splendid
[00:09.48] The animas you broke and left to live
[00:27.98] 
[00:12.76] The sky is torn down
[00:14.23] Like it was the answer
[00:15.63] 'Cause so beautifully done and fallen
[00:17.84] It was your answer
[00:19.17] Who wanna take it back when the end teaches emotions?
[00:22.25] Your breath taught me an ancient law of life
[00:44.25] 
[00:27.09] From miles away
[00:28.08] Flew to tell you how this world you sacrificed (this world you sacrificed)
[00:33.43] To save me
[00:34.46] Is shining in my eyes to show in your eyes
[00:37.50] But found out it was only a dream
[00:54.00] 
[00:39.67] Blinks taken away
[00:41.18] Wish you heard me in here, an empty voice (in here, an empty voice)
[00:46.31] To save me
[00:47.07] Is shining in my eyes to drop in your eyes
[00:50.20] Is it too late to love? For a bit, I feel your answer
[01:16.70] 
[00:53.95] Those words that you gave me
[00:55.74] I'll carve them to my core
[00:57.45] It's me myself who can tell how it's ended and started
[01:00.17] So, I'm just singing aloud to you
[01:02.87] Is it too late to love? For a bit, I feel your answer
[01:29.37] 
[01:06.84] The whole world with the order
[01:08.57] Not yet elucidated
[01:10.27] It's me myself who can tell how it's enchanted
[01:13.18] So, I'm just singing alone to you
[01:15.73] Is it too late to love? For a bit, I feel your answer, darling
[01:46.73] 
[01:31.93] A fairy tale about dystopia
[01:35.08] Come true like our mother's kindness
[01:38.26] The lives we lived, the memories we have left
[01:41.42] The chronicle we walked along
[01:55.92] 
[01:44.77] In 2099, we realized
[01:48.02] We were not the first to reach the end
[01:51.26] The sunshine gently holds me tight and tight
[01:54.40] Makes me feel like an eternity
[02:09.40] 
[02:00.37] From miles away
[02:01.43] Flew to find you
[02:02.76] How this put an end to you (how this put an end to you)
[02:06.66] Like magic
[02:07.61] It gulps you down, drowned in the line
[02:11.09] And yet the sun comes from your place
[02:29.59] 
[02:13.33] Blinks taken away
[02:14.02] Wish you heard me in here, an empty voice (in here, an empty voice)
[02:19.57] To save me
[02:20.43] Is shining in my eyes to drop in your eyes
[02:23.83] Is it too late to love? For a bit, I feel your answer
[02:50.33] 
[02:27.44] Those words that you gave me
[02:29.43] I'll carve them to my core
[02:30.99] It's me myself who can tell how it's ended and started
[02:33.89] So, I'm just singing aloud to you
[02:36.59] Is it too late to love? For a bit, I feel your answer
[03:03.09] 
[02:40.26] When your soul remembers
[02:41.96] To love something once more
[02:43.74] May you embrace it, never ever let it hurt you
[02:46.64] So, I'm just singing aloud to you
[02:48.84] Is it too late to love? For a bit, I feel your answer, darling
